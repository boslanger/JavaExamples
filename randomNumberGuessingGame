 * Choose a random number from 1 to 100. The user attempts to determine the number.
 * - High/low indicator
 * - Variable to store attempts 
 * TODO: 
 * - larger random number
 * - then add a getting warmer or colder if they're too far away. 
 * - example if they're 10-25 away you're hot if they're +100 they're 'colder'
